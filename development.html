<p>
For 22 years Fly FM shows were available live and never heard again. For me, this was a waste of some excellent radio that will never be heard again. 
So as Head of Systems, I set about developing a listen on demand platform for Fly. 
I created a C++ program that finds the name of the current presenter and other necessary metadata and when their show ends writes and runs a shell script. 
This script uploads the show for on demand listening.
